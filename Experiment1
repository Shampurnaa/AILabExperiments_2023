IMPLEMENTATION OF BANANA CAMEL PROBLEM AIM: A PERSON HAS 3000 BANANA AND A CAMEL. 
THE PERSON WANTS TO TRANSPORT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BANANAS TO A DESTINATION WHICH IS 1000 KMS AWAT, USING ONLY THE CAMEL AS A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION, 
THE CAMEL CANNOT CARRY MORE THAN 1000 BANANA EVERY KM IT TRAVELS,
WHAT IS THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF BANANAS THAT CAN BE TRASFERED TO THE DESTINATION USING ONLY CAMEL.
Code:
total_banana = int(input("No. of bananas at the start: "))
distance = int(input("Distance to be covered: "))
load_capacity = int(input("Maximum banana camel can carry at a time: "))

banana_lost = 0
start = total_banana
for i in range(distance):
  while start>0:
    start = start-load_capacity
    if start == 1:
      banana_lost = banana_lost - 1
    banana_lost = banana_lost + 2
  banana_lost = banana_lost - 1
  start=total_banana - banana_lost
  if start==0:
    break
print("Total bananas delivered:",start)

Output:
No. of bananas at the start: 3000
Distance to be covered: 1000
Maximum banana camel can carry at a time: 1000
Total bananas delivered: 533
